    "\n",
    "Voltage is the difference in electric _potential_, i.e. 1 volt is the work done that adds one joule of energy to one coulomb of charge.\n",
    "Voltage is a _relative_ measure. Often, we measure voltage relative to ground (or earth), but voltage can (and is) measured relative to any arbitrary reference point.\n",

    "Resistors are things that obey Ohm's law.\n",
    "(This is all the book has to say about what resistors are.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Resistors restrict the flow of current through a circuit.\n",
    "Obviously, since current flows through them, they are also conductors.\n",
    "For example, a piece of wire has a very low resistance and a high conductivity, while a piece of wood has a very high resistance and a low conductivity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Not all devices obey Ohm's Law, for example, diodes and lamps.\n",
    "An extended version of Ohm's Law allows us to apply it to settings where it otherwise wouldn't work.\n",
    "The idea is to define a _local resistance_, the tangent to the slope of the device's `V-I` curve.\n",
